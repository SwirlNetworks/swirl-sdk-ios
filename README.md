# Swirl Proximity Framework
The Swirl platform is designed as a complete proximity platform detecting a variety of proximity signals like geofence, wifi and beacons and managing presence tracking, notification and content delivery.  The Swirl framework is a component of this system which enables signal detection and content delivery on mobile devices.

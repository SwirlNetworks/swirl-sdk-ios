/**
 *  A SWRLVisit object encapsulates information about places that the user has been. Visit objects are created by
 *  the framework and delivered by the SWRLVisitManager object to its delegate after it receives relevant signal events
 *  from other managers running within the framework.  It monitors the SWRLBeaconManagerDelegate, the SWRLWifiManagerDelegate
 *  and the SWRLRegionManagerDelegate for events related to locations and translates those events into logical visit
 *  events.
 *
 *  The visit includes the location where the visit occurred and information about the arrival and departure times as 
 *  relevant. You do not create visit objects directly, nor should you subclass a SWRLVisit.  You receive these objects
 *  by receiving delegate callbacks from the SWRLVisitManager. See SWRLVisitManagerDelegate.
 *
 *  Visit objects contain as much information about the visit as possible but may not always include both the arrival 
 *  and departure times. For example, when the user arrives at a location, the system may send an event with only an 
 *  arrival time. When the user departs a location, the event can contain both the arrival time 
 *  (if your app was monitoring visits prior to the userâ€™s arrival) and the departure time.

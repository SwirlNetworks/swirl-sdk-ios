### Basic
[Basic](./basic) is a the most basic and straightforward implementation.  As you can see from this example, Swirl can be integrated with only a few lines of code.  ***Coming Soon***

### Swirlx 
[Swirlx](./Swirlx) is a useful test tool and a more complex example designed to use most of the APIs that Swirl provides as well as provide reference implementations for things like the 'mini-bar'.

			<Abstract type="html">A component which manages a working set of Region objects (retreived using the API) that are &apos;near&apos; the users location.
These regions represent both geofences and &apos;control&apos; regions. Geofences have logical location, placement and other metadata associated.
Control regions are used internally by the SDK to control other signal detection, like when to start and stop scanning for beacons or what
iBeacon UUIDs are nearby. This component either starts its own os specific location manager or depends upon the host app
to post location information onto the bus. It generates RegionEnter/RegionExit events onto the bus.</Abstract>

The Swirl Proximity framework gives your application the ability to receive proximity and location events based on the devices current
location.  The framework uses the available hardware to determine the user's position relative to logical locations using signals like advertisements
from Beacons broadcasting in SecureCast, iBeacon or Eddystone protocols, 802.11 wifi networks and GPS.  You use the classes and protocols in this
framework to configure and receive proximity events and optionally configure, receive and display targeted content.
